        Fortitude was architected around one simple principle:
        provide developers with a consistent API to compose views 
        without having to dive into the CSS

        Vertical Rhythm

      <p>
        Good vertical rhythm guides the user's gaze comfortably
        through your content by ensuring consistent,
        predictable vertical spacing between all elements.
        Everything in Fortitude respects a base vertical unit of
        size.

        block__element--modifier syntax keeps you out of the
        documentation and in the markup. Classes in Fortitude
        follow consistent conventions.

        Fortitude classes apply the styles you want without
        inheritence. Writing new functionality is a breeze,
        since you won't have to work around edge cases in 
        your current stylesheets.

        Fortitude allows you to think in visual styles - 
        it's all right there on the surface.
        Build your site's design on top, any way you want.
